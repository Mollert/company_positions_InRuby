This is a company staffing program done in Ruby.
Run the create_company.rb program.
First it asks what is the name of your company.
It asks you to choose from a list of positions to form your staff.
Then it asks for positions that are not on the list.
Then it steps through each position and askes the number of people in that position.
And finally it lists the positions by number of people in that position.

This program uses a hash to keep track of positions and the number of people in them.
It then has to sort the hash.
